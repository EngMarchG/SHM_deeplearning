## Introduction

Structural Health Monitoring (`SHM`) is crucial for ensuring the reliability and longevity of civil engineering structures. This repository employs state-of-the-art deep learning and numerical modeling techniques to detect, quantify, and analyze structural damage. The project bridges advanced computational methods with practical civil engineering applications, offering robust solutions suitable for both academic research and industrial implementation.

## Case Studies

### Chapter 3: Simple Framed Structure

*   **Linear Dynamic Analysis:** Implemented numerical methods to solve the equations of motion for multi-degree-of-freedom (`MDOF`) framed structures, simplifying to single-degree-of-freedom (`SDOF`) for efficient analysis.
*   **Model Development & Optimization:**
    *   Transitioned computational models from Maple to Python, significantly enhancing performance through `NumPy`, `SymPy`, and multi-threading (achieving **~60x speed improvement**).
    *   Constructed extensive datasets (**~250k combinations**) representing structural conditions including incremental damage in Young's Modulus (`E`) and cross-sectional area (`A`).
*   **Deep Learning Application:** Leveraged and significantly improved upon a custom `TabTransformer` architecture by integrating advanced mechanisms such as Residual Networks, Sparse Attention, Mixture-of-Experts (`MoE`), and Squeeze-and-Excite Networks (`SENet`).
*   **Model Performance:** Achieved a final `MAPE` of **4.4%** for individual predictions, enhanced further through stacking ensemble methods down to **1.17%**.

### Chapter 4: Bridge Truss Analysis

*   **Bridge Structural Modeling:**
    *   Detailed exploration of bridge loads per Eurocode standards (`EN 1991-2`), focusing on Warren, Pratt, and Howe trusses.
    *   Geometric design optimized within Eurocode recommended constraints, ensuring realistic force distribution and computational feasibility.
*   **Dataset Creation:**
    *   Generated structured datasets including geometric, mechanical, and modal parameters, optimized for deep learning inputs.
*   **Deep Learning Approach:**
    *   Employed advanced data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning, significantly improving baseline performance from **23.36% `MAPE`** to approximately **1.94%** through innovative custom loss functions.
*   **Predictive Robustness:** Validated predictive performance on extensive unseen datasets, maintaining accuracy and demonstrating resilience to varying structural damage scenarios.

### Chapter 5: Experimental Validation

*   **Experimental Setup:**
    *   Conducted a thorough comparison of theoretical predictions against experimental data using `LVDTs` and photogrammetry for a simply supported steel beam.
    *   Evaluated elastic deflections under incremental loading to validate numerical modeling accuracy.
*   **Validation Results:**
    *   Verified the numerical integrity and accuracy of displacement predictions (within **~3% error** for typical loading conditions).
    *   Identified limitations in photogrammetric measurements, highlighting precision trade-offs in practical monitoring applications.
